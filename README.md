more secure than discord, whatsapp, and clubhouse

# THIS IS A WIP
the encryption used right now is completey implemented wrong. as of now, it's using RSA for messages and AES for the key distribution, which is extremely inefficient and potentially insecure. a lot of things are implemented well either.

## things to work on
- rework encryption
- add more validation for users
- work on adding rooms
- make it neater
